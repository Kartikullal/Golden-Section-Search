# Golden Section Search

The golden-section search is a technique for finding an extremum (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval. For a strictly unimodal function with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them.

## Python implementation of Golden Section Search

For this implementation, we have considered the convex function f(x) = x^2. You can change the convex functiont to whatever you like.

In this implementation, we have also counted the number of steps that will be needed to reach the minimum point.
